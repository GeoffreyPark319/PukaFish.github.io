                        Mega man (or Rock Man in Japan), is a video game character from the Capcom game series of the same name, created by Keiji Inafune.
                        In the games, Mega man is a humanoid robot originally named Rock, who was created by Dr. Light, along with his sister Roll (Yes, there are a lot of music refrences in these games)
                        Rock was originally made as Dr. Light's lab assistant, until Light's former colleague Dr. Wily stole 6 of Lights robot creations known as the Robot Masters, originally made to help people with dangerous tasks, in order to take over the world.
                        Rock then voluenteered to stop the robots and Wily, so Dr. Light upgrades Rock into Mega Man. As Mega Man, he weilds the Mega Buster; a solar energy arm cannon that can also copy data from other Robot Masters
                        allowing him to use their unique abilities. Whith these upgrades, Mega Man stoped the 6 Robot Masters, and Dr. Wily.
